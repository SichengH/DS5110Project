Here's the link to the data: https://data.boston.gov/dataset/property-assessment

Step One: Explor the data (as a buyer or invester) and try to find 
interesting ideas/information. Write it down if you could.

For example: 

Remodeled build each year in each region(zipcode)

#Tyler:
* Changes in `GROSS_TAX` over time by zip code. Possibly using a
  [Choropleth map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choropleth_map). If
  we can show how variables are related to this change then that could
  be neat.
* Identifying existing ownership strategies that seem to be going well
  and figure out why that's happening.
