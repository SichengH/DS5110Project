2. Authors: Nischal Mahaveer Chand, Sumedh Sankhe, Sicheng Hao, Tyler Brown 

3. Summary: (: 2-3 paragraphs summarizing the problem you wish to solve, including a description of the
dataset, and a very brief, non-technical description of your proposed methods)

*Problem: How can we identify top performing property owners to demonstrate dominant strategies to new buyers?

* Description of the dataset:
* Methods: Build a Shiny App to help people visualize our finding
                                                                                                                                                                    



4. (The proposed plan of research: 2-3 paragraphs describing the methods you will use to solve the problem.
These may be processing, visualization, and analytic methods already discussed in class, or it may be
design for infrastructure or an R package for working with a particular type of data, etc.)

*Shiny/Interactive plot
*Map/Google Map interface
