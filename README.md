2. Authors: Nischal Mahaveer Chand, Sumedh Sankhe, Sicheng Hao, Tyler 
   Brown 

3. Summary: (: 2-3 paragraphs summarizing the problem you wish to solve, 
   including a description of the dataset, and a very brief, 
   non-technical description of your proposed methods)

* Problem: How can we identify top performing property owners to 
  demonstrate dominant strategies to new buyers?

* Description of the dataset:

The City of Boston provides an open data platform,
[Analyze Boston](https://data.boston.gov/about), containing information
related to our lives in the city. Property assessment data from 2014-2017
is one of the resources available on their open data platform. Included
within the property assessment data is "property, or parcel, ownership 
together with value information, which ensures fair assessment of Boston 
taxable and non-taxable property of all types and classifications"
(**Citation of dataset here**). Our team has aggregated each available
year to create a time series dataset of Property Assessments in Boston.
This aggregated dataset allows us to provide unique insights into
property valuations and ownership strategies.


* Methods: Build a Shiny App to help people visualize our finding




4. (The proposed plan of research: 2-3 paragraphs describing the methods 
   you will use to solve the problem. These may be processing, 
   visualization, and analytic methods already discussed in class, or it 
   may be design for infrastructure or an R package for working with a 
   particular type of data, etc.)
