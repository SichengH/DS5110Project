1. **Title**: Flashlight: A Property Assessment Visualization for the 
City of Boston

2. **Summary**: As a new homebuyer, it's easy to find out about your home
but hard to get an understanding of your neighborhood. Flashlight
makes it easier for you to see your potential neighborhood in Boston.
This discrepancy is because current real estate websites emphasize
individual properties rather than individual neighborhoods. Our group
communicates the differences between Boston neighborhoods using an
interactive data visualization called Flashlight.

Our dataset includes Property Assessment history from 2014-2017
using Boston's Open Data Hub. We enriched the property assessment data 
with coordinates from Open Addresses, and neighborhood boundaries from 
Zillow. These combined datasets provide unique insights to new
homebuyers in Boston. As open data becomes more prevalent in cities
across the United States, we can scale our insights and models.
